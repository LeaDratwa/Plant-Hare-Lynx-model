This is a three-species model describing the relationship between the consumption of a plant by a herbivore (the hare) which will be subsequently consumed by the predator carnivore (the lynx). This can be descibed by a set of variables where b1 signifies the birth rate of the hares and b2 the birth rate of the lynx, d1 signifies the death rate of the hares while d2 signifies the death rate of the lynx. The time period is defined by a variable t and denotes a time period of 200 months. The increase in the population of plants is correlated with a higher birth rate of hares.
